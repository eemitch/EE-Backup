# EE-Backup
 Backup all the SQL databases for the user and then email and/or FTP away an archive file. This script can be run via a URI or on the command line. Common usage would be to use a CRON to trigger the backup.
  
 I have used this script for years to back up my own website databases. I hope it can be of use to you too.
